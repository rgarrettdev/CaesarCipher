# CaesarCipher

Takes an encypted text file as an input, runs analysis on the text to find the most common letter, assumes the most common letter is e due to frequency analysis on the english language. The difference between the ascii code of the most common letter and that to the letter e is the "key" that was used to encrypt the file. Using this key the file is decrypted and is exported to a new text file.
